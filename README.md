# KPM_ages
A playground for looking at ages and residuals in the context of the K Process model.

## Authors:
- **David W. Hogg**
- **Emily J. Griffith**

## Projects:
- Figure out if the KPM residuals correlate with age.
- Figure out if the KPM residuals come from dredge-up or dilution or additional processes.
- Possibly adjust the KPM to account for age or dredge-up issues.
